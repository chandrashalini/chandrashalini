I'm a Data Science enthusiast who is passionate about digging raw data and turns into meaningful data . Always intrigued by visualizing how novel real-world problems can be solved just by critical thinking and innovation, nothing matters more than just acting at the right time. Some technologies I enjoy working which include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing. 

**Updates:**

🔭 I'm doing master's in Information Systems at Northeastern University, expecting to graduate in May 2022.

🔭 I worked as an Asset Allocation Quantitative Co-op at GMO Investment USA, where I analysed on time series asset data and developed new model for Bond and Currency forecast
