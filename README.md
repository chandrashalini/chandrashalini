I'm a Data Science enthusiast who is passionate about digging raw data and turns into meaningful data . Always intrigued by visualizing how novel real-world problems can be solved just by critical thinking and innovation, nothing matters more than just acting at the right time. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GANS and Natural Language Processing and Business Intelligence.
